# Objective

Develop an app with static and reusable data-driven React components to practice the setup of a React project. This project is a minimal clone of Airbnb Experience.

## Screenshot

## Structure

The app consists of four components:

- NavBar
- Hero (hardcoded)
- Experiences (reusable)
- Footer (hardcoded)

## Tools used

- Vite
- VSCode
- Figma

## Contributing

If you wish to submit improvements, then I welcome forks & pull requests.

## Learning

- React Syntax
- Process of using Create React App
- Using map to access data
- Key prop
- Props: receiving props in a component, destructuring props, passing in non-string props, pass object as props vs. spread object as props
